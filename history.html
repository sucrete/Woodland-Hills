            Woodland Hills Golf Course was for many years a private country club
            that went by the name Fort Scott Country Club. Because of some
            difficult economic times in Fort Scott, the country club also began
            to suffer financially and for many years, fell into disrepair. In
            2012, the City of Fort Scott and many gracious donors stepped in and
            purchased the course, renaming it Woodland Hills Golf Course. At the
            time of the City's purchase, only 8 holes of the 18 were open and
            playable, and the 100-year-old Clubhouse was in need of much repair.
          </p>
          <h4 class="pt-2">Enter, New Superintendent</h4>
          <p>
            After purchasing the course in 2012, The City of Fort Scott hired
            GCSCA Golf Course Superintendent Jon Kindlesparger. Jon has 30 years
            of experience maintaining golf courses such as Alvamar Golf Club in
            Lawrence, KS and Four Oaks Golf Course in Pittsburg, KS. Jon has
            been able to get all 18 holes of the Woodland Hills Golf Course back
            into great condition, making it one of the best public courses in
            South East Kansas. The course is 6100 yards from the back tees and
            features a very challenging layout with undulating bent grass greens
            and plush Bermuda grass fairways.
          </p>
          <h4 class="pt-2">A True Pro</h4>
          <p>
            In the spring of 2016, the City of Fort Scott hired PGA Golf
            Professional Shannon O'Neil, who has 20 years of experience as a PGA
            Golf Professional, managing public and semi-private courses
            throughout the Midwest. Shannon brings a new level of golf knowledge
            and professionalism to Woodland Hills. His specialties are
            tournament operations and teaching.
          </p>
          <h4 class="pt-2">That New Clubhouse Smell</h4>
          <p>
            Also in the spring of 2016, the City of Fort Scott in conjunction
            with the Fort Scott Community College and many donors, built a new
            clubhouse and demolished the old. The new building features a large
            back patio that looks out onto the 9th green and the putting green.
            The next time that you are in the Fort Scott area, make sure to
            bring your clubs and come enjoy one of Southeast Kansas's hidden
            treasures at the Woodland Hills Golf Course in Fort Scott, Kansas!
